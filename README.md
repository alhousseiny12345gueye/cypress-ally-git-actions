# Accessibility Testing CI/CD Demo with Axe, Lighthouse, and Pa11y

This demo repository showcases the implementation of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with accessibility testing using Cypress-Axe in GitHub Actions coupled with cypress cloud. We implemented accessibility testing as part of our CI process

## About the Project

In this project, we have set up CI/CD pipelines that automatically run accessibility tests on every pull request or push to the main branch. These tests help identify accessibility defects early in the development process, making them easier and less costly to fix. The tools we use for these tests include:

### Cypress:

Cypress is a next-generation front-end testing tool built for the modern web. It enables us to write all types of tests like end-to-end tests, integration tests, and unit tests. In this project, we use Cypress for end-to-end accessibility testing.

## Advantages

Implementing accessibility testing in CI/CD pipelines offers several benefits:

Early detection of accessibility defects, making them easier and less costly to fix.
Ensures that new code changes do not introduce accessibility issues.
Helps meet accessibility standards and compliance requirements.
Enhances the user experience by making the app more accessible to all users.


## Conclusion

Incorporating accessibility testing into CI/CD pipelines is a crucial step towards creating more accessible applications. It enables teams to catch and resolve accessibility defects early in the development process, ensuring that their apps are more inclusive and provide better user experiences. This demo repository provides a practical example of how this can be achieved using Cypress-Axe and GitHub Actions.
